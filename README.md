# Google-capstone-project: Case Study 1
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that
are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and
returned to any other station in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.
One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes,
and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers
who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.
